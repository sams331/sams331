# Introduction
Hello, I'm sams331. I'm currently learning to make Discord bots, web development, and OSes.
I started to learn coding since i was 11. I'm not that active these days because of education.

The OSes I use are ![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows_11-0078D6?logo=quarto&logoColor=white) and ![Linux Mint](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux_Mint-you_like?style=flat&logo=linuxmint), also ![Android](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android-you_like?style=flat&logo=android) (obviously).
Now, I'm focusing on my school. When I have time, I will code.
